## Hosted version
To get on the hosted version, contact us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sleuthworld/shared_invite/zt-1n3iw8via-9y1mP3tJ3~Zy6GT5sZNwOg) or sign up [here](https://www.getsleuth.xyz).

## Self-hosted
To get started with Sleuth, you will need to have Pinecone and OpenAI API keys. These should be made available as runtime variables. You will also need to add a Slack bot to your workspace with channel read and channel history permissions. You can enter the Slack bot API token through the frontend in order to sync your Slack messages into Sleuth.
