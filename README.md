## Hosted version
To get on the hosted version, contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dYXkQrkDVt) or sign up [here](https://www.getbuff.io/).

## Self-hosted
To get started on the self-hosted version, [create a Discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) and give it the necessary permissions to read message content and post messages. Swap out the placeholders in `server/discord/bot.py`  with your OpenAI API Key and your Discord Bot Token. Then just run `server/discord/bot.py`  from your server with `nohup` or `systemd` to keep the script running.
