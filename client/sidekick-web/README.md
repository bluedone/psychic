Sidekick is a web demo for our [product](https://github.com/getbuff/Buff) that helps open source communities troubleshoot technical questions with AI. Sidekick itself is also open source. We are trying to make the product more self-serve, but in the meantime please reach out to founders@getsidekick.ai to set it up for your community.

[Try it out here.](https://sidekick-web.vercel.app/)
